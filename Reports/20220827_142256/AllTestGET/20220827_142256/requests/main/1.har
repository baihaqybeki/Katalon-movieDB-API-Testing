His mission soon puts him on a collision course with Gorr and The Mighty Thor (Natalie Portman) who being his ex and wielding his former weapon causes more than a few funny and awkward moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a race to save captured children, rally the gods, and defeat Gorr, Thor, and Jane along with Korr (Taika Waititi) and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), embark on an epic adventure in a race against time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile audiences have come to expect Marvel films to be epic cinematic events, this film is less on the over-the-top action sequences in favor of establishing new circumstances and challenges for the characters going forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there are indeed action sequences and plenty of VFX, it does not have the action or intensity of several of the past films. What it does offer is a good mix of action and humor with enjoyable characters old and new and establishes scenarios for the MCU going forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nBale is very good as Gorr and you understand his motivations clearly as while evil, he has a degree of sympathy towards his character which makes his creepy performance all the more compelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast works very well with one another and there are two scenes in the credits which open up all kinds of possibilities for the future as we are told Thor will return before the credits even begin to roll.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film also has considerable music and I joked to myself that Guns and Roses are going to be getting a big check due to their music being used frequently during the film as well as that of other artists which helps make the film an enjoyable outing from start to finish which should delight fans as we wait to see for the next cinematic offering from Marvel.\\r\\n\\r\\n4 stars out of 5\",\"created_at\":\"2022-07-05T13:08:30.584Z\",\"id\":\"62c437ce22e48038847e2b0c\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-07-05T13:08:30.584Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c437ce22e48038847e2b0c\"},{\"author\":\"MSB\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"MSB\",\"username\":\"msbreviews\",\"avatar_path\":\"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/992eef352126a53d7e141bf9e8707576.jpg\",\"rating\":7.0},\"content\":\"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/thor-love-and-thunder-spoiler-free-review\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Thor: Love and Thunder boasts a bittersweet story about finding peace and love in suffering and pain, without forgetting the necessary thunderous action that reaches its best level in a long sequence surrounded by a breathtaking black-and-white color palette.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristian Bale stands out with a terrifying performance as one of MCU's best villains in recent years, while Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman share excellent chemistry.

The entire first act feels so disjointed and rushed. You get thrown plot point after plot point and get whipped from planet to planet which results in the viewer not being able to lock in on the story. I really enjoyed the scenes we got from Gorr and Jane during this act, but they felt a little underdeveloped and rushed. The comedy was a little thick during this section, some jokes completely missed, but it was nothing that was overbearing that it hurt the experience. Once the movie enters the second act and begins focusing on Jane the entire gets much better. It is here where you can really see the balance that Taika Waititi brought during Ragnarök with some moments rivaling the best from that film. The ending of this film has some really great action and cinematography, some may argue it's among the best in the MCU. As the movie credits rolled, I was very satisfied to the conclusion of this film and am ready for more Thor action in the future.\\r\\nThe acting all around was excellent in this film, I found the dynamic between Jane and Thor worked much better than in previous films. They had real chemistry on screen, and you could feel the love the two previously shared unearth with each additional scene. There are some really great conversations that dive into their relationship that were done fantastically. Christian Bale was menacing as Gorr, his demeanor was sinister and completely unhinged as he delivered crazy laughs while delivering his villain manifesto. It gave me serious flashbacks to Heath Ledger’s Joker. I just wish we got to see more of him in the film, but the bit we did see was top tier villainy in the MCU.\\r\\nThe music in this film blends with the scenes very well. When the Guns N' Roses guitar starts playing you know it is about to go down and I could not help but smile. While the beginning of this film was bad, I can admit, the ending was so great that it averaged out the movie and made it a very enjoyable experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Verdict:** _Good_\\r\\n\\r\\n**Score:** _7/10_\",\"created_at\":\"2022-07-09T20:03:28.675Z\",\"id\":\"62c9df1064de350050dfdb1f\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-07-15T15:10:20.916Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62c9df1064de350050dfdb1f\"},{\"author\":\"Steve Parker\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"Steve Parker\",\"username\":\"steveinadelaide l\",\"avatar_path\":\"/xyE9MCa5m701z6avIlfEgFXmcAx.jpg\",\"rating\":5.0},\"content\":\"**Thor: Love and Thunder** is a sequel to the 2017 film Thor: Ragnarok. It is written and directed by Taika Waititi and based on, of course, the Marvel Comics by Stan Lee. The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster / Mighty Thor, and Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the story? The gods are in danger! The God Butcher is coming for them! And only the mightiest of them all can stop him: Thor. But Thor is in bad shape. He's lost his hammer, his friends, and his confidence. He'll need all the help he can get to save the day. He'll have to relearn what it means to be a hero, and Jane Foster will have to become the Mighty Thor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was looking forward to this movie. I loved Taika Waititi's direction in Ragnarok, and the cast is amazing. I was hoping for another fun, fast-paced, and humorous film like its predecessor. But unfortunately, Thor: Love and Thunder falls flat. The story is convoluted and slow-moving, and there are too many characters for any of them to get enough development. The humour is forced, and it frequently fails. And the ending is just...Stranger things have happened, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was disappointed in **Thor: Love and Thunder**. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might enjoy it, but if you're looking for another fun and exciting Thor film, I think you'll be disappointed, too.\",\"created_at\":\"2022-07-10T08:22:58.350Z\",\"id\":\"62ca8c62e8131d068b119bf7\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-07-10T08:22:58.350Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62ca8c62e8131d068b119bf7\"},{\"author\":\"CinemaSerf\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"CinemaSerf\",\"username\":\"Geronimo1967\",\"avatar_path\":\"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg\",\"rating\":6.0},\"content\":\"This was my favourite of the Marvel franchises, but boy have we now plumbed the depths. Taika Waititi presents us here with a mess of a film that dumps just about all of the original exciting Norse mythology and legend, and substitutes it with something little better than a cartoon. Chris Hemsworth does try quite hard, and nobody could ever doubt Christian Bale's commitment to his roles - he must have lost half his bodyweight as he portrays the emaciated \\\"Gorr\\\". This poor fellow loses his daughter but has hopes that his local god will step in. Nope, as Jordan Peele might have said, and as the evil necro-sword mysteriously appears in his hand, he duly dispatches this thoughtless immortal and thereby vows to do the same for all the rest. When several Asgardian children are kidnapped and taken to the shadowland, it falls to Thor, \\\"King Valkyrie\\\" (Tessa Thompson) and the newly empowered - but terminally ill - \\\"Jane\\\" (Natalie Portman) to thwart this plan. Along the way, they try to recruit some other gods from different pantheons - notably Zeus (a hammily absurd Russell Crowe) but ultimately it's all down to these three to save the day. There is a bit of humour at the start - and maybe Jane Fonda would have been an useful addition, but for the most part this film is neither one thing nor another with too much romance - a serious illness that just didn't belong in a light-heated fantasy film that treats death as an occupational hazard for the characters; and the need to generate and sustain the supporting characters reduced the impact of Thor to little more than a team player in a red cape. The ending is weak, but frankly no more so than most of the rest of this truly disappointing feature. If you stick right to the end of the credits, you will see that perhaps Hercules is to be the next topic for this character - I can only hope Sir Kenneth Branagh is available. Looks great on a big screen, superb visual effects etc., but Marvel have lost their way with this...\",\"created_at\":\"2022-07-11T20:05:19.711Z\",\"id\":\"62cc827fe8d0280052f1c8e1\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-07-11T20:05:19.711Z\",\"url\":\"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62cc827fe8d0280052f1c8e1\"},{\"author\":\"Chris Sawin\",\"author_details\":{\"name\":\"Chris Sawin\",\"username\":\"ChrisSawin\",\"avatar_path\":\"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf3b87ecb40599290d764e6d73c86319.jpg\",\"rating\":6.0},\"content\":\"To be fair, Waititi has some really funny material in _Love and Thunder_.

Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative.
